    "\n",
    "1. **Mission 2.1 (Supervised Learning)**: \n",
    "   - Solve a supervised learning problem using a multilayer perceptron (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mission 2.2 (Unsupervised Learning)**:\n",
    "   - Given an unlabeled dataset, your task is to cluster similar data points and achieve 100% clustering accuracy. You will not have access to the true labels, but you can verify your cluster assignments using the Kaggle competition provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Delivery Format (Blackboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit **two files**:\n",
    "1. The completed Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "2. The solution for the second dataset as a CSV file with two `int` columns: `['ID', 'cluster']`.\n",

    "- Invitation link: https://www.kaggle.com/t/dfb72837bdb346449768b8f6ce50b6dc\n",
    "- Kaggle is a popular platform for data science competitions.\n",
    "- It allows us to create a Private competition where you can submit your solutions and verify whether you are thinking in the right direction.\n",
    "- The results of the competition is visible only to the competition participants. \n",
    "- We will not grade the submissions on Kaggle, we set it up to let you check your clustering.\n",
    "- You still have to deliver the `.csv` file of the solution and the complete `.ipynb` notebook with discussions and solution code.  \n",

    "The NTNU Intelligence team has intercepted encrypted documentation that potentially reveals the locations of AI-compromised servers within Trondheim. Our analysts believe the data contains information about these servers' locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the number of servers and their exact positions remain unknown. To execute a strategic response, we need to understand the intercepted data and pinpoint the main AI servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also discovered a vulnerability in the AI's security: it has deployed a clustering verification feature on Kaggle. We can exploit this backdoor to validate our clustering hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Your Mission\n",
    "Identify the number of hidden servers (clusters) in the dataset. Assign cluster labels to each row in the original dataset and validate your clustering solution on Kaggle.  When achieved the perfect clustering accuracy, find the precise locations of these servers (clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 The Challenge\n",
    "1. **Large Dataset**: The intercepted data file contains numerous features, making direct manipulation and clustering difficult. Applying dimensionality reduction techniques could help reveal patterns.\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: No target labels are provided, so you must identify patterns based solely on the dataset's features.\n",
    "3. **Data Obfuscation**: The AI has obfuscated the data, making it difficult to discern its true structure. You must effectively manipulate the data to visually identify server locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Your Tools\n",
    "- The intercepted AI dataset.\n",
    "- Skills in feature engineering, data manipulation, and visualization.\n",
    "- Clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN, Birch, Agglomerative Clustering, etc.) — [Clustering in Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, Isomap, UMAP, etc.)\n",
    "- Kaggle competition platform with a daily submission limit of 50 attempts.\n",

    "### 📊 Formal Requirements\n",
    "1. **Achieve 100% Clustering Accuracy** on Kaggle.\n",
    "> Note: The only way to check whether your clustering is correct is to submit it to Kaggle. We do not give you the clusters directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Discussion Questions**:\n",
    "   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Which dimensionality reduction methods helped you determine the correct number of clusters? Why did some methods work better than others? Explain the differences between PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.\n",
    "   - **Clustering Approach**: Which clustering algorithm and hyperparameters did you use? Discuss the differences between algorithms like KMeans and DBSCAN.\n",
    "   - **Data Type Analysis**: What is the hidden data type in the dataset? How does this information influence feature extraction for clustering? Can it explain why some dimensionality reduction algorithms are more effective?\n",
    "   - **Server Locations**: Identify the server locations. List the specific facilities in Trondheim and explain how you deduced their locations.\n",
    "   - **Advanced Task (Optional)**: Extract features using modern pre-trained neural networks for this data type. Apply dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms to the extracted features."

    "\n",
    "The clustering accuracy metric evaluates how well the predicted clusters match the true clusters, irrespective of the specific labels or names assigned to the clusters.\n",

    "This means that the evaluation is solely based on the correct grouping of data points rather than the numerical labels of the clusters themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name-Independent**: The metric cares only about how well the data points are grouped together, not the specific numerical or categorical labels used for the clusters.\n",
    "- **Focus on Grouping**: The evaluation rewards cluster assignments that correctly group the same data points together, regardless of the specific labels assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If the true cluster assignments are:\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## How the Metric is Computed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contingency Matrix**: \n",
    "   - Construct a contingency matrix that represents the overlap between the true clusters and the predicted clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimal Correspondence**: \n",
    "   - Use an optimization algorithm, such as the Hungarian method (linear sum assignment), to find the best possible correspondence between true and predicted labels, maximizing the number of correctly assigned data points.\n",

    "3. **Accuracy Calculation**: \n",
    "   - Calculate the accuracy as the ratio of correctly matched data points to the total number of data points.\n",
